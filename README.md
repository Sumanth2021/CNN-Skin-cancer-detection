# Project Name
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
This uses a dataset of about 2357 images of skin cancer types. The dataset contains 9 sub-directories in each train and test subdirectories. The 9 sub-directories contains the images of 9 skin cancer types respectively.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Model 1 - Without Augmentation and dropout layer
    Model overfits
- Model 2 - Using dropout layer
    Model is more accurate
- Model 3 - Augmenting the data to handle class imbalance
    Best training and validation accuracy
